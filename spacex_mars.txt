Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the vision to make human life multi-planetary. The company quickly built expertise in commercial launch vehicles, starting with Falcon 1’s historic flight in 2008. By 2010, the larger Falcon 9 rocket was successfully launched, opening opportunities for crewed and cargo missions. SpaceX became the first private company to dock with the International Space Station via the Dragon spacecraft in 2012.

The Falcon rockets enabled partnerships with NASA and private satellite operators, laying the groundwork for more ambitious projects. The company pioneered reusable boosters with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, aiming to drastically reduce launch costs and set new standards for reliability.

From 2014, SpaceX began development of Starship, envisioned as a fully reusable spacecraft for journeys to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Musk announced test flights and planned uncrewed missions to Mars, targeting the 2026/27 transfer window. The company projected up to 500 missions by 2033, hoping to transport thousands for settlement and resource development.

The Mars program prioritizes sustainable resource generation: Starship is designed to synthesize methane fuel from Martian water and atmosphere using the Sabatier reaction, supporting return journeys and local energy needs. Crews would be tasked with building propellant plants and Mars Base Alpha, the first permanent base, by 2028.

SpaceX logistics include satellite projects for global communications—details of these ventures are spread across Musk’s network of companies. Their connectivity solutions link to innovations in energy storage and AI, essential for autonomous operations and communication across vast distances.
